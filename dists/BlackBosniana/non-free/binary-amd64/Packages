 .
 This package provides the source code for the wl kernel modules and makes use
 of the DKMS build utility to install them for the running kernel. The
 alternative package broadcom-sta-source can be used instead in case of build
 problems.
 .
 The wireless-tools package is also required in order to make use of these
 modules. Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.

 This package provides the source code for the wl kernel modules. It makes use
 of kernel-package or module-assistant build systems. The alternative
 broadcom-sta-dkms package can be installed instead and might be easier to use
 with simple system configurations.
 .
 The wireless-tools package is also required in order to make use of these
 modules.  Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.

Description: mkfs and fsck for HFS and HFS+ file systems
 The HFS+ file system used by Apple Computer for their Mac OS is
 supported by the Linux kernel.  Apple provides mkfs and fsck for
 HFS+ with the Unix core of their operating system, Darwin.
 .
 This package is a port of Apple's tools for HFS+ filesystems.
 .
 For users, HFS+ seems to be a good compromise to carry files between
 MacOS X and Linux Machines, as HFS+ doesn't suffer the problems of
 FAT32 like:
 .
  * huge space waste (in slack space as devices grow faster);
  * ability to create files that are more than 4GB in size (especially
    good for those working with multimedia and that need to carry large
    ISO files);
  * ability to use case preserving (and even sensitivity!);
  * ability to use uid's and gid's on the filesystem.
 .
 Users in general can enjoy such benefits since it is expected to have
 more HFS+ filesystems in use, as Apple has announced Macintoshes for
 ix86-64, besides the filesystem being already supported by PowerPC
 systems since the beginning.

Description: Firmware loader for M-Audio's MidiSport devices
 This package allows you to use M-Audio's USB MIDI and Audio interfaces with
 Linux. These devices require a firmware download before an operating system
 driver (e.g. ALSA's snd-usb-audio) can access them.
 .
 Supported devices:
  - MidiSport 1x1
  - MidiSport 2x2
  - MidiSport 4x4
  - MidiSport 8x8
  - KeyStation (old models: 49, 61)
  - Oxygen
  - Radium49
  - Radium61
  - Uno
 The loader is not required for the MidiSport 2x4 and for newer KeyStation
 models (49e, 61es, Pro 88).

Description: dkms source for the r8168 network driver
 r8168 is the Linux device driver released by RealTek for their network
 controllers with PCI-Express interface:
  * 10/100/1000M Gigabit Ethernet: RTL8111B, RTL8111C, RTL8111D, RTL8111E,
    RTL8111F, RTL8111G(S), RTL8111H(S), RTL8118(A)(S), RTL8119i, RTL8111L,
    RTL8111K, RTL8168B, RTL8168E, RTL8168H, RTL8111DP, RTL8111EP, RTL8111FP,
    RTL8411, RTL8411B
 .
 This driver should only be used for devices not yet supported by the
 in-kernel driver r8169. Please see the README.Debian for instructions how
 to report bugs against r8169 that made it necessary to use r8168-dkms.
 .
 Installation of the r8168-dkms package will disable the in-kernel r8169
 module. To re-enable r8169, the r8168-dkms package must be purged.
 .
 This package provides the dkms source code for the r8168 kernel modules.
 Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.
